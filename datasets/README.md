# Dataset setup

Overall, we used three datasets in our study:

- Toy Dataset (toy_data_generation): A 3D toy dataset, where the task is to segment simple geometric structures, i.e. spheres and cubes
- LIDC-IDRI Dataset (lidc-idri): A lung CT dataset, where the task is to segment lung nodules, also 3D
- GTA 5 / Cityscapes dataset: Combination of the GTA 5 and the Cityscapes dataset, where the task is to segment street scenes, a 2D dataset

For instructions on how to preprocess the individual datasets, see the respective subfolders, each containing a README with detailed instructions.
